This is a practice website project that I've completed. It is for a start up fake company called "Life Kickz"
who sell premimum, new, and exclusive sneakers such as Nike, Jordan, and Adidas. They will compete with already
established companies such as Foot Locker and Footaction. I sought to create a website than stands out from the 
competition with bright colors and interactiveness. Product placement of rare shoes was also a goal to grab the
attention of the consumer
